## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Global Superstore sales data from 2011 to 2014. By leveraging the power of Power BI, I have developed an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore sales trends, regional performance, product category analysis, and the impact of discounts on profitability.

## 2. Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

* **Sales Data:** This dataset contains detailed information on individual sales transactions, including order date, product details, customer information, sales amount, discount applied, and profit generated.
* **Geographical Data:** This dataset includes country and region information, which is used for the geographical visualization of sales data.  *(Provide a link to the data source if publicly available)*

## 3. Data Import and Preparation

The data was imported into Power BI Desktop. The following steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis:

* **Data Cleaning:** [Mention any data cleaning steps, e.g., handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, etc.]
* **Data Transformation:** [Mention any data transformations, e.g., creating calculated columns like year, month, sales by category, profit margin, discount percentage, etc.]
* **Data Modeling:** [Describe the relationships established between the Sales Data and Geographical Data tables, if any.]

## 4. Visualizations

The Power BI report includes the following visualizations:

* **Quantity by Month and Category (Line Chart):**  This chart displays the trend of product quantity sold over time, broken down by product category.  It helps identify seasonal patterns and popular product categories.
* **Sales by Country and Region (Map Chart):** This map visualizes sales performance across different geographical locations, providing insights into regional market share and sales concentration.
* [Add at least 5 more visualizations and describe them.  Examples:]
    * **Sales and Profit by Category (Bar Chart):** Compares sales and profit generated by different product categories.
    * **Discount Impact on Profit (Scatter Plot):**  Explores the correlation between discount percentage and profit, revealing the optimal discount strategy.
    * **Sales by Year (Line Chart):** Tracks overall sales performance over the four-year period.
    * **Top Performing Products (Table/Matrix):**  Displays a ranked list of the best-selling products.
    * **Profit Margin by Region (Bar Chart):** Compares profitability across different regions.
    * **Customer Segmentation by Sales (Treemap):**  Visualizes customer segments based on their sales contribution.
    * **Average Order Value by Category (Column Chart):**  Compares average order values across product categories.

## 5. Interactive Dashboard

The interactive dashboard allows users to explore the data and gain deeper insights:

* **Slicers:**  Enable users to filter data by year, region, product category, and other relevant dimensions.
